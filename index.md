Popcorn Hack 1
Make a code cell that show usage of compound assignment in a Data Type Operations.

// Compound Assignment with Number
let x = 10;
console.log("Initial x:", x);

// Using compound assignment for addition
x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5
console.log("After x += 5:", x);

// Using compound assignment for multiplication
x *= 2; // equivalent to x = x * 2
console.log("After x *= 2:", x);


// Compound Assignment with Array
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
console.log("\nInitial myArray:", myArray);

// Using compound assignment to concatenate arrays
myArray += [4, 5]; // This won't work as expected; use .concat instead
myArray = myArray.concat([4, 5]);
console.log("After myArray.concat([4, 5]):", myArray);


// Compound Assignment with String
let myString = "Hello";
console.log("\nInitial myString:", myString);

// Using compound assignment for string concatenation
myString += " World!"; // equivalent to myString = myString + " World!"
console.log("After myString += ' World!':", myString);

Popcorn Hack 2
Make a code cell that changes block into a square, versus HD resolution
